This repository contains the FPGA logic and software that runs on ODrive [v2](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODriveHardware/tree/master/v2).

## Main development
Currently the main development of ODrive is focused on v3. The relevant repositories are:
* [ODriveFirmware](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODriveFirmware): Firmware that runs on the board.
* [ODrive](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODrive): Configuration and analysis scripts that runs on a PC.
* [ODriveHardware](https://github.com/madcowswe/ODriveHardware): Circuit board design
